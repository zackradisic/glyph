# Glyph

This is my personal text editor that I am building for fun and to get more familiar with OpenGL.

Glyph is designed for my own personal use, as a result I've made engineering and design decisions that suit only my own needs.

[I'm writing about the engineering process here](https://zackoverflow.dev), where I talk about some of the technical details of building Glyph.
